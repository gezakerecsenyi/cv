                <p>
                    Hi! I'm a self-taught developer and software engineer, originally from Hungary, but having grown up
                    in Manchester. I'm currently studying Philosophy & Linguistics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, and
                    hope to go into NLP and AI in the future. I have experiences from working on a wide range of
                    freelance projects in my spare time alongside my side-projects, many of which have primarily
                    focused on web development but also branched out far beyond that. I'm particularly interested in
                    taking on projects that stretch my boundaries and allow me to develop new skills in AI, algorithm
                    development, and software and hardware engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're interested in learning more about any of the projects listed here, would like to
                    collaborate on something exciting, or would simply like a chat, please feel free to email me at
                    the address listed below.

                I was a member of the Programming Society and a founding member of CyberSoc, the school's forum for
                talks from both students and outside experts on the world of tech and software development. I
                participated in the Informatics Olympiad, achieving the highest score in my school. I created various
                pieces of software for my school, including a data entry, query, and display system for the annual
                Sports Day, a chip-timing system using <span class='lang-block'>ESP32</span>-enabled
                custom-programmed RFID scanning for the alumni running race, a registration system for school parents'
                evenings, and a graph-theory optimised allocation system for distributing prefect roles, as part of my
                position as the school's Vice Captain.

                When our school reached the final round of the Ritangle mathematics competition, the team nominated me
                to lead the development of an algorithm for finding a solution to a domain-specific travelling salesman
                problem, which I approached through a Monte Carlo-based regression using a neural-network trained
                heuristic function in <span class='lang-block'>C/C++</span>. These results were then manually vetted
                through a series of
                <i>"equations"</i>
                I had made in an instance of the Desmos graphing calculator, exploiting glitches in the calculator tool
                to enable Turing-complete computation through a mathematical
                <i>"standard library"</i>
                I had developed some years prior.

            <p>
                One of my first ever large-scale programming endeavours, the creation of CodeDragon - a
                <span class='lang-block'>Blockly</span>
                based platform for learning to write HTML and CSS using real syntax - has been an incredibly rewarding
                experience. Through our non-profit The CodeDdraig Organisation, our platform, featuring our
                open-source editor called the <i>"Ffau"</i>, had amassed thousands of users, with hundreds of schools
                from around the world signed up to use our teacher-specific classroom tools. Beyond the
                implementation of a Blockly sandbox, I led the creation of a "reverse coding" feature that translated
                edits to the generated HTML code back into Blockly XML through manual parsing and interpolation
                steps, as well as creating a custom trending and recommendation algorithm for users to discover new
                projects, powered by a custom neural network trained on both visual and textual content of the users'
                projects.

                Initially starting out as a freelancer, I was asked to take over the development team of the
                Singaporean start-up OpenForum, currently in the process of building a social media platform
                centering on community interaction and bridging the gap between Western and Asian social networking
                cultures. Notably, the site itself is styled as a giant platformer game, wherein users browse posts
                by moving their avatar through a physics-enabled bento grid of content.
            </p>

            <p>
                The complexity of this project hinges on the need for user interaction to be at the forefront of all
                experiences on the platform, which has pushed me both as a developer and a product designer. Ranging
                from integration of "tipping" of creators through <span class='lang-block'>Stripe</span> Connect, to
                proximity-based voice-calling features, keeping the site performant while simulating the physics of
                hundreds of avatars moving at once across dynamically-loaded content has required experimentation in
                <span class='lang-block'>WASM</span>, a mixed
                <span class='lang-block'>Rust</span>/<span class='lang-block'>Node.js</span> back-end, and attention
                to detail at every stage of the development process.

                When I was chosen to be Editor-in-Chief for my school's Magazines Committee, it became apparent that
                mandating every designer on the team to purchase a copy of Affinity Publisher would not be a
                sustainable approach. Therefore, I embarked on the project of creating a free-to-use, open-source piece
                of publishing software, which seeks not only to implement but to improve upon many of my favourite
                features of industry-standard software like Affinity Publisher. Effectively just a giant
                <span class='lang-block'>Typescript</span> project, implementing a program of this scale required
                creating custom viewport handlers and a component management system from scratch (as I opted not to use
                React or similar frameworks for this, given the difficulties they introduce with user-defined content).
                The centrepiece of the program is the custom property relationship definition tool, which takes the
                traditional concept of "master pages" to new heights, by allowing users to programmatically define -
                using a visual node-editor language - relationships that certain properties need to take and maintain
                between each other, such as the first letter of a paragraph being bigger, or the width of an image
                always being twice its height. This required many iterations to ensure all statements could be
                fully reversible (i.e. that if a user changed the height, the width could be calculated from this
                too) and the system could preempt and handle errors in the node 'code' in a user-friendly manner.

                As part of my interest in linguistics and partially inspired by some (painstakingly-assembled) examples
                of <a href='https://i.redd.it/lombenpfp2v31.jpg' target='_blank'>etymology trees ðŸ¡¥</a>, I decided to
                create a tool to automatically generate such graphs (which show words in various different languages
                that share a common root with a provided word) for arbitrary user input. Intending to use
                openly-available Wiktionary API data for this purpose, the development turned out much more difficult
                than initially anticipated, as between parsing the human- (and <i>not</i> machine-)readable Wiktionary
                entries and throttling requests to avoid rate limiting, the process of requesting all of the
                necessary data distributed between often hundreds of entry pages required complex GCP configurations
                to minimise server costs, especially while still figuring out how to solve the frequent infinite-loop
                issues in a deeply recursive searching environment. In the end, a
                <span class='lang-block'>Node.js</span> script spawning instances on <span class='lang-block'>GCP</span>
                to manage the requesting using a domain-specific <span class='lang-block'>NLP</span> parser, while
                progressively dumping partial results into a livestreamed Firebase Firestore database so the user
                doesn't just stare at a blank screen until the generation is complete, worked a charm.

                Frustrated by the available offering of freelancing websites, we decided to design and develop a new
                type of freelance platform, whereby the site itself decides on socially-optimal prices for any given
                pairing of buyer and seller using an ELO-based algorithm. My role was to design the formulae, which
                numbered in the hundreds, for various actions on the site, including the effects of user interactions
                and local economic conditions (supply/demand for a given service on the site) on price, the effects
                of subject-specific and global ratings on buyer and seller ELO scores, and the effects of ELO on a
                given price match-up. I implemented these formulae in <span class='lang-block'>Go</span>, while
                <span class='lang-block'>Node.js</span> was selected for running the actual webserver for the site,
                with Protobuf streaming between the two servers. As the platform required a wide range of different
                processing features, ranging from payment handling through <span class='lang-block'>Stripe</span>
                Connect, to image and video preview and processing, and even video calling capability, we adopted a
                microservice-based approach with <span class='lang-block'>Kubernetes</span> clusters to manage the
                connection between them.

                    command execution to allow real-time reporting of the optimiser progress (which could take
                    minutes to run). Also implemented device-locked key-based authentication, which users could buy
