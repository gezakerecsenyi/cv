                </h3>

                <p>
                    Hi! I'm a self-taught developer and software engineer, originally from Hungary, but having grown up
                    in Manchester. I'm currently studying Philosophy & Linguistics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, and
                    hope to go into NLP and AI in the future. I have experiences from working on a wide range of
                    freelance projects in my spare time alongside my side-projects, many of which have primarily
                    focused on web development but also branched out far beyond that. I'm particularly interested in
                    taking on projects that stretch my boundaries and allow me to develop new skills in AI, algorithm
                    development, and software and hardware engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're interested in learning more about any of the projects listed here, would like to
                    collaborate on something exciting, or would simply like a chat, please feel free to email me at
                    the address listed below.

                I am currently completing my Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Linguistics at the University of
                Oxford. I intend to specialise towards Uralic linguistics, particularly exploring areas of linguistic
                documentation and fieldwork. I am also interested in combining my interests through such fields as
                computational linguistics and application of grammatical theories to programming language design.

                participated in the Informatics Olympiad, achieving the highest score in my school. I created various
                pieces of software for my school, including a data entry, query, and display system for the

                When our school reached the final round of the Ritangle mathematics competition, the team nominated me
                to lead the development of an algorithm for finding a solution to a domain-specific travelling salesman
                problem, which I approached through a Monte Carlo-based regression using a neural-network trained
                heuristic function in <span class='lang-block'>C/C++</span>. These results were then manually vetted
                through a series of

                Initially starting out as a freelancer, I was asked to take over the development team of the
                Singaporean start-up OpenForum, currently in the process of building a social media platform
                centering on community interaction and bridging the gap between Western and Asian social networking
                cultures. Notably, the site itself is styled as a giant platformer game, wherein users browse posts
                by moving their avatar through a physics-enabled bento grid of content.
            </p>

            <p>
                The complexity of this project hinges on the need for user interaction to be at the forefront of all
                experiences on the platform, which has pushed me both as a developer and a product designer. Ranging
                from integration of "tipping" of creators through <span class='lang-block'>Stripe</span> Connect, to
                proximity-based voice-calling features, keeping the site performant while simulating the physics of

            <p>
                When I was chosen to be Editor-in-Chief for my school's Magazines Committee, it became apparent that
                mandating every designer on the team to purchase a copy of Affinity Publisher would not be a
                sustainable approach. Therefore, I was inspired to create a free-to-use, open-source piece
                of publishing software, which seeks not only to implement but to improve upon many of my favourite
                features of industry-standard software like Affinity Publisher.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project employs a homebrew object-oriented rendering system in
                <span class='lang-block'>Typescript</span> to handle the visual viewport, and features layer-based
                editing functionality with property adjustment alongside WYSIWYG inputs. The core design philosophy
                of the interface is reusability of components for rapid production capacity following the initial
                design stage, leading me to implement the concept of "super-masters": effectively, groups of
                objects - be they text, images, or design elements - which can be dropped into the canvas and follow
                context-based rules, programmed in by the user through a custom-made node editor environment. This
                allows for functionality such as using mathematical operators in expressing relationships between
                objects' positions or the size of various sections of text, which can remain flexible even as the
                page content changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design of the node-based markup language required much consideration from a
                theoretical standpoint, so as to ensure that all possible "programs" are fully reversible. For
                instance, in the case a user defines a rule whereby the height of an image depends on a textbox's
                position, but the user then uses the WYSIWYG functionality to alter the height of the image directly: in
                this case, the program needs to run the relationship definition "in reverse" to work out what to set the
                position of the textbox to.

                As part of my interest in linguistics and partially inspired by some (painstakingly, manually
                assembled) examples
                of <a href='https://i.redd.it/lombenpfp2v31.jpg' target='_blank'>etymology trees ðŸ¡¥</a> on social
                media, I decided to create a tool to automatically generate such graphs (which show words in various
                different languages that share a common root with a provided word) for arbitrary user input. Intending
                to use openly-available Wiktionary API data for this purpose, the development turned out much more
                difficult than initially anticipated, as between parsing the human- (and <i>not</i> machine-)readable
                Wiktionary entries and throttling requests to avoid rate limiting, the process of requesting all of the
                necessary data distributed between often hundreds of entry pages required complex GCP configurations
                to minimise server costs, especially while still figuring out how to solve the frequent infinite-loop
                issues in a deeply recursive searching environment. In the end, a
                <span class='lang-block'>Node.js</span> script spawning instances on <span class='lang-block'>GCP</span>
                to manage the requesting using a domain-specific <span class='lang-block'>NLP</span> parser, while
                progressively dumping partial results into a livestreamed Firebase Firestore database so the user
                doesn't just stare at a blank screen until the generation is complete, worked a charm.

                By the invitation of Youtuber <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@GeorgeCollier'>George Collier</a>, I
                joined the team responsible for developing a musical training mobile application. My particular role
                was to create a set of back-end tools that allowed the musical team to generate content for the
                application: specifically, to allow for easy creation of vast sets of pairings of musical notation
                and their corresponding audio equivalents, as played by MIDI instruments, as well as the metadata
                required to allow for importing these into the application.
            </p>

            <p>
                This undertaking eventually morphed into Highscore, a completely custom, fully-functional programming
                language based in its syntax loosely on Lisp and PHP, but with various declarative-flavoured
                elements, specifically designed to handle musical notation and easy reading/writing of large amounts
                of data. To bring it in line with the strengths of the other team members, I wrote the runtime in
                Node.js with Typescript, with a command-line utility for running programs written in the
                <code>.hsc</code> format. This would in turn read through the provided script file, providing standard
                libraries for all important music-related datasets (keys, modes, notes, etc.), and having support for
                musical datatypes as primitives and for generating musical engraving and audio through native syntax.

                Frustrated by the available offering of freelancing websites, we decided to design and develop a new
                type of freelance platform, whereby the site itself decides on socially-optimal prices for any given
                pairing of buyer and seller using an ELO-based algorithm. My role was to design the formulae, which
                numbered in the hundreds, for various actions on the site, including the effects of user interactions
                and local economic conditions (supply/demand for a given service on the site) on price, the effects
                of subject-specific and global ratings on buyer and seller ELO scores, and the effects of ELO on a
                given price match-up. I implemented these formulae in <span class='lang-block'>Go</span>, while
                <span class='lang-block'>Node.js</span> was selected for running the actual webserver for the site,
                with Protobuf streaming between the two servers. As the platform required a wide range of different
                processing features, ranging from payment handling through <span class='lang-block'>Stripe</span>
                Connect, to image and video preview and processing, and even video calling capability, we adopted a
                microservice-based approach with <span class='lang-block'>Kubernetes</span> clusters to manage the
                connection between them.

                At ETH Oxford 2025, we competed against hundreds of other teams on various tracks. Given the Web-3
                theme of this competition, our team of two - my partner working on UI and direction, and myself doing the
                bulk of the front- and back-end implementation - sought to create a project that incorporated areas of
                computational <span class='lang-block'>cryptography</span>, machine learning, information access, and
                accessibility. The result of this 36-hour sprint was Newscrypt
                (<a href='https://newscrypt.xyz' target='_blank'>Website ðŸ¡¥</a>,
                <a href='http://github.com/gezakerecsenyi/newscrypt' target='_blank'>Github ðŸ¡¥</a>), a submission to
                <a href='https://torex.rs/' target='_blank'>Torus' ðŸ¡¥</a> bounty to create a platform that displayed and
                analysed ongoing debates on "crypto Twitter".
            </p>
            <p>
                We went well beyond the initial spec in our creation, aiming to integrate multiple themes of the hackathon
                beyond the simple platform that was requested. One feature that took particular innovation was our
                <span class='spooky'>custom authentication</span> (sound scary, I know - but don't worry, it's thoroughly
                proven/vetted) system: the <i>HUMAN Handshake</i>. This involves using face authentication in place of
                a username, thereby ensuring a liveness check at every sign-in to prevent bot accounts contributing on
                the website's forum feature. To maintain user security, their facial data is never seen by anyone except
                them. We use locality-sensitive hashing, then further salted and encrypted, to encode an extracted
                128-component embedding of the user's facial structure, and compare this to the stored encrypted value
                to see if they match. To boost the accessibility of our site, we also somehow found the time to implement
                full <span class='lang-block'>i18n</span> into five languages, including AI-powered auto-translation of all
                user- (and LLM-) generated content.
            </p>
            <p>
                To actually generate the debate summaries, we use the <span class='lang-block'>OpenAI API</span> combined
                with an international news API to generate requests to make from the Twitter API. We then use an
                agential analysis model - based on
                <a href='https://storm-project.stanford.edu/research/storm/' target='_blank'>
