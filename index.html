                <p>
                    Hi! I'm a self-taught developer and software engineer, originally from Hungary, but having grown up
                    in Manchester. I'm currently studying Philosophy & Linguistics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, and
                    hope to go into NLP and AI in the future. I have experiences from working on a wide range of
                    freelance projects in my spare time alongside my side-projects, many of which have primarily
                    focused on web development but also branched out far beyond that. I'm particularly interested in
                    taking on projects that stretch my boundaries and allow me to develop new skills in AI, algorithm
                    development, and software and hardware engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're interested in learning more about any of the projects listed here, would like to
                    collaborate on something exciting, or would simply like a chat, please feel free to email me at
                    the address listed below.

                participated in the Informatics Olympiad, achieving the highest score in my school. I created various
                pieces of software for my school, including a data entry, query, and display system for the

                When our school reached the final round of the Ritangle mathematics competition, the team nominated me
                to lead the development of an algorithm for finding a solution to a domain-specific travelling salesman
                problem, which I approached through a Monte Carlo-based regression using a neural-network trained
                heuristic function in <span class='lang-block'>C/C++</span>. These results were then manually vetted
                through a series of
                <i>"equations"</i>
                I had made in an instance of the Desmos graphing calculator, exploiting glitches in the calculator tool
                to enable Turing-complete computation through a mathematical
                <i>"standard library"</i>
                I had developed some years prior.

                One of my first ever large-scale programming endeavours, the creation of CodeDragon - a
                <span class='lang-block'>Blockly</span>
                based platform for learning to write HTML and CSS using real syntax - has been an incredibly rewarding
                experience. Through our non-profit The CodeDdraig Organisation, our platform - which features our
                open-source editor, called the
                <a href='https://github.com/codeddraig/ffau' target='_blank'>
                    <i>"Ffau"</i> ðŸ¡¥
                </a> - had amassed thousands of users, with hundreds of schools from around the world signed up to use
                our teacher-specific classroom tools. Beyond the implementation of a Blockly sandbox, I led the creation
                of a "reverse coding" feature that translated edits to the generated HTML code back into Blockly XML
                through manual parsing and interpolation steps, as well as creating a custom trending and recommendation
                algorithm for users to discover new projects, powered by a custom neural network trained on both visual
                and textual content of the users' work.

                Initially starting out as a freelancer, I was asked to take over the development team of the
                Singaporean start-up OpenForum, currently in the process of building a social media platform
                centering on community interaction and bridging the gap between Western and Asian social networking
                cultures. Notably, the site itself is styled as a giant platformer game, wherein users browse posts
                by moving their avatar through a physics-enabled bento grid of content.
            </p>

            <p>
                The complexity of this project hinges on the need for user interaction to be at the forefront of all
                experiences on the platform, which has pushed me both as a developer and a product designer. Ranging

            <p>
                When I was chosen to be Editor-in-Chief for my school's Magazines Committee, it became apparent that
                mandating every designer on the team to purchase a copy of Affinity Publisher would not be a
                sustainable approach. Therefore, I was inspired to create a free-to-use, open-source piece
                of publishing software, which seeks not only to implement but to improve upon many of my favourite
                features of industry-standard software like Affinity Publisher.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project employs a homebrew object-oriented rendering system in
                <span class='lang-block'>Typescript</span> to handle the visual viewport, and features layer-based
                editing functionality with property adjustment alongside WYSIWYG inputs. The core design philosophy
                of the interface is reusability of components for rapid production capacity following the initial
                design stage, leading me to implement the concept of "super-masters": effectively, groups of
                objects - be they text, images, or design elements - which can be dropped into the canvas and follow
                context-based rules, programmed in by the user through a custom-made node editor environment. This
                allows for functionality such as using mathematical operators in expressing relationships between
                objects' positions or the size of various sections of text, which can remain flexible even as the
                page content changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design of the node-based markup language required much consideration from a
                theoretical standpoint, so as to ensure that all possible "programs" are fully reversible. For
                instance, in the case a user defines a rule whereby the height of an image depends on a textbox's
                position, but the user then uses the WYSIWYG functionality to alter the height of the image directly: in
                this case, the program needs to run the relationship definition "in reverse" to work out what to set the
                position of the textbox to.

                As part of my interest in linguistics and partially inspired by some (painstakingly, manually
                assembled) examples
                of <a href='https://i.redd.it/lombenpfp2v31.jpg' target='_blank'>etymology trees ðŸ¡¥</a> on social
                media, I decided to create a tool to automatically generate such graphs (which show words in various
                different languages that share a common root with a provided word) for arbitrary user input. Intending
                to use openly-available Wiktionary API data for this purpose, the development turned out much more
                difficult than initially anticipated, as between parsing the human- (and <i>not</i> machine-)readable
                Wiktionary entries and throttling requests to avoid rate limiting, the process of requesting all of the
                necessary data distributed between often hundreds of entry pages required complex GCP configurations
                to minimise server costs, especially while still figuring out how to solve the frequent infinite-loop
                issues in a deeply recursive searching environment. In the end, a
                <span class='lang-block'>Node.js</span> script spawning instances on <span class='lang-block'>GCP</span>
                to manage the requesting using a domain-specific <span class='lang-block'>NLP</span> parser, while
                progressively dumping partial results into a livestreamed Firebase Firestore database so the user
                doesn't just stare at a blank screen until the generation is complete, worked a charm.

                By the invitation of Youtuber <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@GeorgeCollier'>George Collier</a>, I
                joined the team responsible for developing a musical training mobile application. My particular role
                was to create a set of back-end tools that allowed the musical team to generate content for the
                application: specifically, to allow for easy creation of vast sets of pairings of musical notation
                and their corresponding audio equivalents, as played by MIDI instruments, as well as the metadata
                required to allow for importing these into the application.
            </p>

            <p>
                This undertaking eventually morphed into Highscore, a completely custom, fully-functional programming
                language based in its syntax loosely on Lisp and PHP, but with various declarative-flavoured
                elements, specifically designed to handle musical notation and easy reading/writing of large amounts
                of data. To bring it in line with the strengths of the other team members, I wrote the runtime in
                Node.js with Typescript, with a command-line utility for running programs written in the
                <code>.hsc</code> format. This would in turn read through the provided script file, providing standard
                libraries for all important music-related datasets (keys, modes, notes, etc.), and having support for
                musical datatypes as primitives and for generating musical engraving and audio through native syntax.

                Frustrated by the available offering of freelancing websites, we decided to design and develop a new
                type of freelance platform, whereby the site itself decides on socially-optimal prices for any given
                pairing of buyer and seller using an ELO-based algorithm. My role was to design the formulae, which
                numbered in the hundreds, for various actions on the site, including the effects of user interactions
                and local economic conditions (supply/demand for a given service on the site) on price, the effects
                of subject-specific and global ratings on buyer and seller ELO scores, and the effects of ELO on a
                given price match-up. I implemented these formulae in <span class='lang-block'>Go</span>, while
                <span class='lang-block'>Node.js</span> was selected for running the actual webserver for the site,
                with Protobuf streaming between the two servers. As the platform required a wide range of different
                processing features, ranging from payment handling through <span class='lang-block'>Stripe</span>
                Connect, to image and video preview and processing, and even video calling capability, we adopted a
                microservice-based approach with <span class='lang-block'>Kubernetes</span> clusters to manage the
                connection between them.
